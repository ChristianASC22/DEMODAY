      About Food Waste
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      Food waste in America is a very serious issue. Around 30-40 percent of food in America is considered wasted each year. This food could have been used by people who needed it more.

    <h3>
      But what can you do to stop food waste?
    </h3>
    
    <ul class="noBullets">
      <li><b>1. Only take what you can eat.</b> If you take too much food, some will be wasted. Know your limits. It is better to take a little and get more food afterward.</li>
      <li><b>2. Donate excess food you have.</b> If you can't eat the food, the someone else can. Give away your extra food to people in need.</li>
      <li><b>3. Check expiration dates often.</b> Any expired food will most likely be thrown out, so be sure not to waste food that is close to expiring.</li>
      <li><b>4. Compost extra food.</b> If you're growing a garden, you might want to think of using your food as compost. Compost is biowaste that helps your plants grow.</li>
    </ul>
